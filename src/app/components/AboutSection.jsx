                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m a senior studying Statistics and Data Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
                        I have a strong passion for statistics, data science, machine learning, and deep learning. 
                        My goal is to keep learning about these exciting fields (and really anything I can learn) for as long as I can. 
                        This website is a fun little side thing for me to post about what I'm doing and just generally things I like!
